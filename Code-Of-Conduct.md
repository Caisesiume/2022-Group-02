How do we plan to collaborate?

We are a well knit group that during this project will work all together on all tasks (if possible), this to broaden the individual learning outcome. We plan to avoid splitting up assignments to “save time”, because it has lessened learning outcomes in the past.
Most of our collaboration will take place online and on Discord (or zoom if needed). We prefer to run the code-sessions this way to make it so that all can see and interact (live share or similar software) simultaneously. After these years of distance studies we have developed some working techniques and strategies regarding meeting and other groups related interactions that we find to work well, we intend to use these in this project as well and therefore we will conduct most of our non-programming sessions online as well. 
We plan on having planned and set meetings/session slots on Wednesday as well as Fridays, these days suit our individual schedules well and let us put down multiple hour in continuum to not lose the “flow”. We feel that we, as a group, aren't performing at our best with small sessions and rather use long ones so as not to lose the momentum.
As we plan on working together on all assignments we feel that the scrum practises as a whole don’t work for us. For instance would not a scrum meeting make much sense because we intend to all work together on all parts. But we will still use the essence of agile development in this project. 

How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual Contributions?

The majority of the communication between team members, including individual contributions will be through Discord. Individual contributions may be through voice calls during the meetings. Individual contributions may also occur through text communication, which provides an alternative resource to look up previous individual contributions. Every team member is expected to regularly attend voice meetings and check for new text-based messages.
If one or more team members lose access to Discord or are unavailable during meetings, then vital information may be communicated through phone-based messages/calls.

How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

Through regular meetings, where every team member is involved, our plan is to jointly develop and produce a solution. Due to team-programming, our gain in knowledge should be equivalent across all team members, primarily since questions and/or progressing through the development phase, may lead to clarifications. Team-programming ensures that knowledge is jointly accumulated.

What is our usual communication plan?

The plan is to utilize Discord for communication within the team. Both voice and text communication within the group occurs in Discord. If one or more team members miss out on information, then the other team members will communicate the most vital information/summary to that team member.
How will we solve conflicts?

As of yet, no conflicts have occured. The priority of our group is to have ‘openness’ and ‘transparency’ between all team members. Each member is free to voice their opinions, concerns, and views, free of conflicts. We expect each and every team member to act in a respectful manner towards another team member.
In the unexpected case where conflicts do occur, then a discussion between all team members will take place, and where every team member is able to voice their opinion.
