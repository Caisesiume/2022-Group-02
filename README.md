# 2022-group-02 | Project Name

## Description

Description here.

## Visuals
To be added.

`"Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method."
`
## Installation
To be added.

`"Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection."
`
## Usage
The system will be able to detect cones and detemine needed steering for the wheels. 

## Roadmap
Our roadmap is somewhat described by the planned tasks we have documented on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/qO0KZTiw/dit638-project-group-02).

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.
